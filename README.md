# CloutChain

## ðŸš€ Project Description

CloutChain is an advanced analytics platform that predicts the **virality** of Zora coins. The platform leverages **powerful attention models** to assign virality scores to coins â€” helping traders identify them before they gain widespread attention. Users can filter new/trending posts by virality score, visualise market data, and set up trading thresholds based on virality metrics. The platform combines **social media sentiment analysis** with historical price patterns to generate **actionable investment recommendations**, facilitating informed trading activities.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

CloutChain consists of three main components:

1. **Virality Prediction Engine**: AI models that score Zora content based on likelihood to become viral
2. **Frontend Dashboard**: Interactive application with filters for trending posts and virality thresholds
3. **Trading Automation**: System that enables users to set buy/sell parameters based on virality scores

Users can explore trending content, and set custom virality thresholds for trading actions.

## ðŸ”Œ Sponsor Technology Usage

Our project integrates Zora technology through the `@zoralabs/coins-sdk` package to access real-time token data and content information. We analyse Zora content for **virality prediction**, track token movements, and provide users with actionable insights â€” specifically optimised for the Zora ecosystem. This integration allows our platform to identify potentially viral content early and forecast market movements based on **social engagement patterns**.
