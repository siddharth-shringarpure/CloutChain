# CloutChain

## ðŸš€ Project Description

CloutChain is an advanced analytics platform that predicts the **virality** of Zora coins. The platform leverages **powerful attention models** to assign virality scores to coins â€” helping traders identify them before they gain widespread attention. Users can filter trending posts by virality score, visualise market data, and set up trading thresholds based on virality metrics. The platform combines **social media sentiment analysis** with historical price patterns to generate **actionable investment recommendations**, facilitating informed trading activities.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

CloutChain consists of three main components:

1. **Virality Prediction Engine**: AI models that score Zora content based on likelihood to become viral
2. **Frontend Dashboard**: Interactive application with filters for trending posts and virality thresholds
3. **Trading Automation**: System that enables users to set buy/sell parameters based on virality scores

Users can explore trending content, and set custom virality thresholds for trading actions.

## ðŸ”Œ Sponsor Technology Usage

Cloutchain integrates Zora technology through the `@zoralabs/coins-sdk` package to access real-time token data and content information. We analyse Zora content for **virality prediction**, track token movements, and provide users with actionable insights â€” specifically optimised for the Zora ecosystem. This integration allows our platform to identify potentially viral content early and forecast market movements based on **social engagement patterns**.
